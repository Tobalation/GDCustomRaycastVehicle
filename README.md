# Custom RayCast based vehicle implementation for Godot 3.x
A custom raycast vehicle implementation emphasizing simplicity and adaptability.

The raycast elements serve as a basis for any type of land vehicle that needs to be suspended by "springs"

## In this project:

The example vehicle in this project is a tank type vehicle with 10 raycasts total (5 per side).
All raycasts provide drive power. The vehicle has tracked vehicle steering (with neutral steering).

## What about that smooth orbit camera?
